# verilog-assignments
Source code for various assignments that required Verilog-based design.

Each of these projects can be simulated using either Xilinx Vivado or EDA Playground.

## Projects

- [Combinational Logic Design](/Combinational%20Logic%20Design): A combinational circuit which counts the coins placed into a toll collector. Implemented on the XC7A100T-1CSG324C Xlinx FPGA Board.

- [Serial Sequence Controller](/Serial%20Sequence%20Controller): A controller that detects the 4-bit, binary MSB sequence of a certain integer (i.e. 6). Implemented on the Nexys4 DDR™ FPGA Board.

- [64 Bit Adder Implementations](/64-Bit%20Adder%20Implementations): Three different implementations of a 64-bit adder using ripple-carry and 2-bit look ahead adders, in addition to a behavioral design.

- [ARM ALU Behavioral](/ARM%20ALU%20Behavioral): A bottoms-up behavioral implementation of a simple ALU that uses six 4-bit controls and two operands.
